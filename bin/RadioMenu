##  An fvwm menu to present a selection of radio stations as defined by a config file (radiorc).
##  The selected radio station is played via mpv. Actions also exist to play the next/prev 
##  radio station. But if MPD is playing rather than radio/mpv, then the next/prev MPD 
##  tracks will be played instead.
